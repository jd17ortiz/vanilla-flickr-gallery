# Vanilla Javascript Flickr Gallery

## Getting started

 - To start the program you only need to execute the command "npm install", you need to have installed node and NPM as well.
 - To change gallery or just play with the data from flickr check flickr-api.js (app/js/flickr-api.js).
 - The gallery can handle multiple instance.

 Cheers!
